# Upstream gap: athlete-level periodization parameters

## Summary

TP-014 probed intervals.icu's public OpenAPI docs for athlete-profile and training-plan endpoints on 2026-05-11. The API documents training-plan assignment metadata, plan folders, planned events, workout targets, and fitness/wellness metrics, but it does not expose athlete-level planning parameters for:

- ramp-rate percentage;
- recovery-week cadence;
- taper percentage drop;
- intensity-distribution preference.

icuvisor should not compute these values client-side. If intervals.icu exposes explicit fields later, `get_planning_parameters` can ship with only the fields confirmed available, following the PRD availability rule that missing upstream fields are omitted rather than zero-filled.

TP-196 adds `get_annual_training_plan` as a separate read-only summary of per-event calendar signals that are already exposed today: PLAN, TARGET, and NOTE events plus their load/time/distance targets. A non-empty event `plan_applied` timestamp is provenance that a NOTE came from an applied ATP; a null/empty value identifies ordinary personal context. It is not an athlete-level planning parameter and does not establish recovery semantics. The tool does not use `for_week`, names, tags, or localized text as provenance, and it keeps personal notes outside ATP counts. This tool does not close this upstream gap and must not present inferred ramp-rate, recovery-cadence, taper-drop, or intensity-distribution preferences as configured athlete-level parameters. Its responses include caveats and a projection bridge only for explicit weekly TARGET load rows.

Checked endpoint/schema areas:

| Area | Documented fields relevant to planning | Gap verdict |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/v1/athlete/{id}` | `training_plan_id`, `training_plan_start_date`, device workout-upload range preferences | No athlete-level periodization parameters. |
| `GET /api/v1/athlete/{id}/profile` | `AthleteProfile.athlete` wrapper around the athlete schema | No athlete-level periodization parameters. |
| `GET /api/v1/athlete/{id}/training-plan` | `athlete_id`, `training_plan_id`, `training_plan_start_date`, `timezone`, `training_plan_last_applied`, `training_plan`, `training_plan_alias` | Training-plan assignment only; no planning-parameter fields. |
| `PUT /api/v1/athlete-plans`, `PUT /api/v1/athlete/{id}/training-plan` | `id`, `training_plan_id`, `training_plan_start_date`, `training_plan_alias` | No writable planning-parameter hints; write probing was out of scope. |
| `GET /api/v1/athlete/{id}/folders` | `rollout_weeks`, `duration_weeks`, `hours_per_week_min`, `hours_per_week_max`, `workout_targets`, `starting_ctl`, `starting_atl` | Plan metadata only; no ramp, recovery cadence, taper, or distribution preference. |
| `GET /api/v1/athlete/{id}/events{format}` | `icu_training_load`, `load_target`, `time_target`, `distance_target`, `target`, `icu_intensity`, `plan_applied`, plan linkage fields, PLAN/TARGET/NOTE categories | Per-event values only, not athlete-level periodization settings. `plan_applied` is event provenance for applied ATP rows, not a recovery cadence or other athlete preference. These values are sufficient for `get_annual_training_plan` summaries but not for configured ramp/recovery/taper/distribution parameters. |
| `GET /api/v1/athlete/{id}/fitness-model-events` | Fitness-model event categories such as `FITNESS_DAYS`, `SET_FITNESS`, `SET_EFTP` | No planning-parameter fields. |
| `GET /api/v1/athlete/{id}/workouts`, `GET /api/v1/athlete/{id}/workouts/{workoutId}` | `icu_training_load`, `target`, `targets`, `plan_applied`, `for_week`, `icu_intensity` | Per-workout values only, not an athlete-level intensity-distribution preference. |

Near-match fields found elsewhere:

- `Wellness.rampRate`
- `SummaryWithCats.rampRate`

Those near-matches are observed fitness/wellness metrics, not configurable athlete- or coach-level periodization parameters.

No authenticated live probe was run because this worktree did not contain a `.env` file. No raw API responses or athlete identifiers were committed.

## Requested fields and use cases

### Ramp-rate percentage

A coach or self-trained athlete may want the API to expose the configured weekly load progression, such as a 5-8% weekly ramp. Forum post #28 in thread 123739 describes this as an explicit setting coaches may want to review or adjust: "Weekly progression: Just a standard exponential ramp (around 5-8% a week)" and later calls ramp rates the kind of explicit setting a coach could set differently.

Requested upstream shape: an explicit numeric percentage field, with units and scope documented, for example `ramp_rate_percent` on an athlete planning-parameters resource.

### Recovery-week cadence

A plan generator or coach workflow needs to know how often lower-load recovery weeks are scheduled, instead of inferring cadence from generated workouts. Forum post #28 references "baked-in recovery weeks" as part of the load-planning logic, and the requested API field would make that cadence inspectable.

Requested upstream shape: an explicit cadence field such as `recovery_week_cadence` with a documented unit, for example every N weeks or an enumerated strategy.

### Taper percentage drop

Race-week and event-specific planning need to distinguish normal training-load changes from an intentional taper. Forum post #28 describes tapering as "A progressive ~40% volume drop based on Bosquet," while forum post #30 discusses using ATL and CTL to manage the taper. An explicit taper setting would let icuvisor report the configured taper policy without inventing it from calendar data.

Requested upstream shape: an explicit `taper_drop_percent` or equivalent field, with the taper window/scope documented.

### Intensity-distribution preference

An LLM planning assistant should not infer whether an athlete or coach prefers polarized, pyramidal, or another distribution from workouts after the fact. Forum post #28 describes "Either Seiler's polarized model (80/20) or pyramidal" depending on context. Exposing this preference would let icuvisor report the selected strategy and its scale without reverse-engineering planned workouts.

Requested upstream shape: an enum such as `intensity_distribution_preference` with documented values, for example `polarized`, `pyramidal`, or `custom`, plus optional distribution percentages if upstream stores them.

### Copy-paste-ready feature-request draft

Title: Expose athlete-level periodization planning parameters in the public API

```text
Hi intervals.icu team,

Could the public API expose athlete-level periodization/planning parameters when those settings are stored upstream?

Requested fields:

- ramp-rate percentage, e.g. the configured weekly load progression;
- recovery-week cadence, e.g. every N weeks or the configured recovery-week strategy;
- taper percentage drop and taper-window scope;
- intensity-distribution preference, e.g. polarized, pyramidal, custom, and optional distribution percentages if stored.

Use case: integrations such as local MCP/LLM assistants need to report an athlete or coach's configured planning assumptions without deriving them from activities, planned workouts, or generated calendar data. Client-side derivation would risk misrepresenting coach intent. Per-event fields such as `icu_intensity`, workout targets, folder metadata, and observed metric fields such as `rampRate` are useful, but they do not identify the athlete-level planning preferences themselves.

Evidence checked in the current public OpenAPI docs:

- `GET /api/v1/athlete/{id}` exposes training-plan assignment metadata, but no periodization parameters.
- `GET /api/v1/athlete/{id}/profile` wraps the athlete schema and does not expose these settings.
- `GET /api/v1/athlete/{id}/training-plan` exposes assignment metadata such as `training_plan_id`, `training_plan_start_date`, timezone, last-applied state, and aliases, but no ramp/recovery/taper/distribution settings.
- Folder, event, fitness-model-event, and workout endpoints expose plan metadata or per-event/per-workout targets, not athlete-level periodization preferences.
- `Wellness.rampRate` and `SummaryWithCats.rampRate` appear to be observed metrics rather than configurable planning assumptions.

A small read-only resource such as `GET /api/v1/athlete/{id}/planning-parameters` would be enough for this use case, but any documented schema/path is fine. Missing values could simply be omitted or returned as null according to intervals.icu's existing API conventions.

Thanks!
```

Once filed, replace the placeholder above with the forum/support URL and update the TP-014 status file.
