# Plan-Filler Constraint Model and Validator

**Status:** In progress — constraint model implemented, `fill_calendar_from_library` tool not yet shipped.
**Related roadmap item:** v2.0 Plan Filler (`fill_calendar_from_library`)
**Package:** `internal/planning`

---

## Field Semantics and Units

All duration fields (`MaxDurationMinutes`, `MaxIndoorMinutes`, `MaxTotalDailyMinutes`, `WeeklyTargetMinutes`, `CompletedMinutes`, `FixedMinutes`, `CandidateMinutes`, `RemainingMinutes`, `ProjectedMinutes`, and `DurationMinutes` in `CandidateSession`) use **`float64` representing minutes**.

`time.Duration` (nanoseconds) was not used because:
- This domain operates on human-scale planning intervals (30 min, 90 min, 2 h) where `float64` minutes are natural, readable, and free of unit-conversion error when multiplied or compared.
- All JSON-serialisable output fields use `float64` for forward-compatible transport; `time.Duration` (an `int64`) would require custom marshalling.
- The constraint model has no sub-minute precision requirement; `float64` minutes carry sufficient accuracy for the target use case.

The convention is uniform across all four input structs (`SlotConstraint`, `DayConstraints`, `WeekConstraints`, `CandidateSession`) and all `Reconciliation` fields.

Load fields (`WeeklyTargetLoad`, `CompletedLoad`, `FixedLoad`, `CandidateLoad`, `RemainingLoad`, `ProjectedLoad`, and `Load` in `CandidateSession`) use **`float64` representing TSS/ATL load points** — the same unit convention used by `propose_annual_training_plan` and `get_fitness_projection`.

---

## Purpose

The planning constraint package provides a deterministic, pure validator for the plan-filler scheduling domain. It answers one question before any calendar writes happen:

> "Given these week-level targets, daily availability windows, and per-slot caps, is this candidate session placeable — and does placing the full batch leave the weekly load within bounds?"

The package contains no intervals.icu client calls, no calendar writes, no workout selection, no model inference, and no physiology classification. All inputs are caller-supplied numeric structs; free-text instructions are never treated as hard constraints.

---

## Key Invariants

1. **Availability ≠ requested sessions.** `AvailableDays` encodes *where* sessions may be placed. `RequestedSessionCount` encodes *how many* sessions the caller wants placed. Having five available days does not imply five sessions are requested, and requesting three sessions does not create availability on days absent from `AvailableDays`.

2. **Remaining target ≠ full-week target.** For an in-progress week, the validator uses `WeeklyTargetLoad - CompletedLoad - FixedLoad` (the *remaining* budget) as the scheduling cap. The full-week target is preserved for reporting but is never used as the overshoot threshold for new sessions. This prevents filling an in-progress week to its full original target when part of the week has already passed.

3. **Slots do not combine.** A candidate session must fit within exactly one slot. Two 45-minute slots cannot accommodate a 95-minute session. Sessions do not span slot boundaries.

4. **Indoor and outdoor caps are independent.** A slot can declare a `MaxIndoorMinutes` that is shorter than its `MaxDurationMinutes`. An outdoor session of 90 minutes in a slot with `MaxDurationMinutes=120` and `MaxIndoorMinutes=60` is valid; the same duration as an indoor session violates the indoor cap only.

5. **Fixed events reduce remaining budget, not availability.** Races, A-priority events, and unavailable blocks are represented as `FixedMinutes`/`FixedLoad` in `WeekConstraints`. They are subtracted from the weekly target to compute the remaining budget but are not candidates themselves and do not occupy `AvailableDays` slots.

6. **Deficits are never redistributed silently.** If the remaining load budget is zero or negative (completed + fixed already meet the target), the validator emits a `zero_remaining_load` warning and lets the caller decide. It never invents availability or adjusts the target downward to accommodate a request.

## Result Codes

### Violation Codes (hard — block placement)

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `day_unavailable` | Candidate date absent from `AvailableDays` or `MaxSessionsPerDay` is zero. |
| `daily_session_count_exceeded` | Adding the candidate would exceed `MaxSessionsPerDay`. |
| `daily_time_exceeded` | Combined daily duration would exceed `MaxTotalDailyMinutes`. |
| `slot_duration_exceeded` | Candidate duration exceeds EVERY available (unconsumed) slot's `MaxDurationMinutes`. Only emitted when the reason is universal across all slots. |
| `indoor_duration_exceeded` | Indoor candidate duration exceeds EVERY available slot's `MaxIndoorMinutes`. Only emitted when universal. |
| `sport_not_allowed` | Candidate sport is excluded by EVERY available slot's `AllowedSports`. Only emitted when universal. |
| `mode_not_allowed` | Candidate mode is excluded by EVERY available slot's `AllowedModes`. Only emitted when universal. |
| `no_compatible_slot` | No available slot fits the candidate and no single constraint is universal across all slots (mixed-reason rejection, e.g. slot A rejects for duration, slot B for sport). |
| `no_available_slot` | All slots for the day have been consumed by prior candidates in a batch pass; `MaxSessionsPerDay` has not yet been reached but no slots remain. |
| `weekly_load_overshoot` | Candidate load exceeds the remaining weekly load budget. |
| `weekly_time_overshoot` | Candidate duration exceeds the remaining weekly time budget. |
| `requested_session_count_exceeded` | This candidate would be the (N+1)th valid session; `RequestedSessionCount` is N. Position in the batch determines priority. |

### Warning Codes (soft — caller attention required)

| Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `infeasible_session_count` | `RequestedSessionCount` exceeds total structural slots across all days. Structural capacity only; does not filter by sport or mode. |
| `infeasible_load` | Total candidate load (including invalid candidates) is less than the remaining weekly load target. |
| `zero_remaining_load` | Remaining load budget is zero or negative. Fires unconditionally when remaining ≤ 0, regardless of the candidate's own Load value. |
| `zero_remaining_time` | Remaining time budget is zero or negative. Parallel to `zero_remaining_load` for the time dimension. |

---

## Validation Logic

### Single-candidate validation (`ValidateCandidate`)

1. **Day check:** find the `DayConstraints` for the candidate date; return `day_unavailable` if absent or `MaxSessionsPerDay == 0`.
2. **Daily session count:** if `sessionsAlreadyOnDay >= MaxSessionsPerDay`, emit `daily_session_count_exceeded`.
3. **Combined daily duration:** if `MaxTotalDailyMinutes > 0` and the new total would exceed it, emit `daily_time_exceeded`.
4. **Slot matching:** find the first available slot where all constraints pass (duration, indoor cap, sport, mode). If none found, emit violation codes for constraints that are universally violated (every slot rejects for the same reason). If no reason is universal (slot A rejects for duration, slot B for sport), emit `no_compatible_slot` as the deterministic fallback.
5. **Weekly load:** compute `remainingLoad = WeeklyTargetLoad - CompletedLoad - FixedLoad - priorLoad`. If `remainingLoad ≤ 0`, emit `zero_remaining_load` warning (unconditional; fires regardless of `candidate.Load`). Otherwise if `candidate.Load > remainingLoad`, emit `weekly_load_overshoot`.
6. **Weekly time:** compute `remainingMin = WeeklyTargetMinutes - CompletedMinutes - FixedMinutes - priorMinutes`. If `remainingMin ≤ 0`, emit `zero_remaining_time` warning (parallel to `zero_remaining_load`). Otherwise if `candidate.DurationMinutes > remainingMin`, emit `weekly_time_overshoot`.

### Batch validation (`ValidateCandidates`)

Processes candidates in order, maintaining per-day session counts, per-day cumulative duration, and accumulated weekly load/time from prior candidates.

**Slot consumption:** each slot holds at most one session. When a candidate passes all slot-level constraints (duration, indoor, sport, mode), it claims that slot and the slot is removed from the available set for subsequent candidates on the same day. This is independent of other violations — a candidate that finds a compatible slot claims it even if it also has a weekly overshoot violation, because the time window is "occupied" in the proposed schedule. When all slots for a day are consumed but `MaxSessionsPerDay` has not been reached, subsequent candidates receive `no_available_slot`.

**RequestedSessionCount cap:** once `RequestedSessionCount` violation-free candidates have been accepted, subsequent valid candidates receive `requested_session_count_exceeded`. Position in the batch determines priority. A `RequestedSessionCount` of 0 means no cap is applied.

**Accumulation is pessimistic (all candidates, including invalid ones).** All proposed candidates increment the day session counter and the per-day minute total, regardless of their validity. This ensures deterministic, position-based rejection: if sessions 1 and 2 are proposed for a day with `MaxSessionsPerDay: 1`, session 2 receives `daily_session_count_exceeded` regardless of whether session 1 is valid for other reasons. Weekly `priorLoad` and `priorMinutes` are likewise accumulated from all candidates, so that budget checks for candidate N account for the full load of candidates 1…N-1. Invalid candidates that would never be placed are included in this total.

The `WarnInfeasibleLoad` check uses the sum of all candidates' load (including invalid ones). A batch containing invalid sessions with non-zero load may suppress this warning even though those sessions will not be placed.

**Slot-count feasibility** (`WarnInfeasibleSessionCount`) compares `RequestedSessionCount` against structural slot capacity (sum of `min(MaxSessionsPerDay, len(Slots))` across available days). This count does not filter by sport or mode; a "Swim" candidate against a Ride-only slot would still count as a structural slot.

After individual validation, adds week-level warnings:
- `infeasible_session_count` if `RequestedSessionCount > structuralSlotCount`.
- `infeasible_load` if total candidate load cannot satisfy the remaining load budget.

### Reconciliation (`Reconcile`)

Computes totals arithmetically. Does not validate. Can be called independently of validation for reporting purposes.

## Examples

### In-progress week with partial completion

```
WeeklyTargetLoad: 300      CompletedLoad: 120     FixedLoad: 0
→ RemainingLoad = 180

Candidate(Load: 200) → ViolationWeeklyLoadOvershoot (200 > 180)
Candidate(Load: 150) → Valid (150 ≤ 180)
```

### Two separate 45-minute slots

```
Day slots: [{MaxDurationMinutes: 45}, {MaxDurationMinutes: 45}]

Candidate(DurationMinutes: 95) → ViolationSlotDuration  (no single slot holds 95 min)
Candidate(DurationMinutes: 45) → Valid                   (fits in either slot)
```

### Indoor vs outdoor cap

```
Slot: {MaxDurationMinutes: 120, MaxIndoorMinutes: 60}

Candidate(DurationMinutes: 90, Indoor: false) → Valid              (outdoor, 90 ≤ 120)
Candidate(DurationMinutes: 90, Indoor: true)  → ViolationIndoorDuration (indoor, 90 > 60)
```

### Fixed events and remaining budget

```
WeeklyTargetLoad: 400    FixedLoad: 150    CompletedLoad: 0
→ RemainingLoad = 250

Candidate(Load: 300) → ViolationWeeklyLoadOvershoot (300 > 250)
Candidate(Load: 250) → Valid
```

### Zero remaining load

```
WeeklyTargetLoad: 300    CompletedLoad: 200    FixedLoad: 150
→ RemainingLoad = -50

Candidate(Load: 50) → Warning: zero_remaining_load
                      (target already met by completed + fixed)
```

### Infeasible session count

```
RequestedSessionCount: 5
AvailableDays: [{MaxSessionsPerDay: 1, Slots: [...]}, {MaxSessionsPerDay: 1, Slots: [...]}]
→ totalAvailableSlots = 2

BatchResult.Warnings: [infeasible_session_count (requested 5, have 2 slots)]
```

## Boundary Conditions

| Condition | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `WeeklyTargetLoad == 0` | Load overshoot checks are skipped; no load violations or zero-load warnings. |
| `WeeklyTargetMinutes == 0` | Time overshoot checks are skipped. |
| `FixedLoad + CompletedLoad > WeeklyTargetLoad` | RemainingLoad is negative; `zero_remaining_load` warning fires unconditionally (regardless of `candidate.Load`). |
| `FixedMinutes + CompletedMinutes > WeeklyTargetMinutes` | RemainingMinutes is negative; `zero_remaining_time` warning fires unconditionally. |
| `MaxSessionsPerDay == 0` | Day is treated as unavailable; `day_unavailable` fires. |
| `len(Slots) == 0` | Slot constraints are skipped; only day-level and weekly checks apply. Sessions per day are capped only by `MaxSessionsPerDay`. |
| All slots consumed by prior candidates | `no_available_slot` fires even if `MaxSessionsPerDay` not yet reached. |
| `MaxDurationMinutes == 0` on a slot | Duration cap is uncapped for that slot. |
| `MaxIndoorMinutes == 0` on a slot | No indoor cap applies for that slot. |
| Empty `AllowedSports` on a slot | Any sport is allowed for that slot. |
| Empty `AllowedModes` on a slot | Any mode is allowed for that slot. |

## Scope Boundaries

This package validates constraints. It does not:
- Select workouts from a library.
- Write calendar events.
- Infer athlete physiology, age, recovery time, or training history.
- Apply ramp-rate or intensity-distribution guardrails (those are v2.2 scope).
- Fetch data from intervals.icu or any upstream service.
- Accept or enforce free-text instructions as hard constraints.

The v2.2 science-backed guardrails (ramp rate, recovery cadence, intensity distribution) are a separate concern that builds on top of this constraint layer. This package deliberately has no knowledge of them.
