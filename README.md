> icuvisor is an open-source, local-first [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server for [intervals.icu](https://intervals.icu), shipped as a single signed Go binary so athletes and coaches can talk to their training data from Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, and other MCP-compatible clients. Your intervals.icu API key stays in the OS keychain, not in an icuvisor cloud service or MCP tool argument. There is no icuvisor-hosted account, onboarding credit, SaaS quota, or subscription gate. Usage limits from your AI client or model provider, GitHub/package downloads, and intervals.icu account are separate. End-user docs live at <https://icuvisor.app>.

## For users

### Why icuvisor

icuvisor is designed to keep training-data access simple, local, and easy for an AI assistant to use correctly:

- **Local-first by default:** your intervals.icu API key is read by the local `icuvisor` process from the OS keychain or an explicit headless fallback, not passed as an MCP tool argument.
- **One binary to install:** the server ships as a Go binary with shell installers and package-manager paths, so setup does not depend on a language runtime in the user's AI chat.
- **Structured, terse responses:** read tools return compact JSON-shaped results by default, with fuller payloads behind explicit `include_full` options for cases such as raw streams.
- **Gear names when they are knowable:** activity summaries and details include `gear_id` plus `gear_name` for bikes, shoes, and other gear when intervals.icu exposes a resolvable gear item; unresolved IDs keep an explicit `gear_resolution` status instead of inventing a name.
- **Units and scales are explicit:** distances, paces, work, hydration, and related fields use unit-labelled names or `_meta` legends so the model does not have to infer whether a value is kilometres, miles, kilojoules, or a 1-5 rating. Activity fuel fields distinguish active `calories_burned`, athlete-logged `carbs_ingested_g`, upstream `carbs_used_g`, and wellness `kcal_consumed` intake.
- **Profile readiness warnings:** athlete-profile reads flag missing sport thresholds or zones in `_meta.warnings` so the assistant can ask you to update settings before producing threshold- or zone-based analysis and plans.
- **Calendar writes are safety-shaped:** assistants can add workouts, notes, races, and unavailable date ranges such as Sick, Injured, or Holiday blocks; range writes are per-day, retry-safe, and report same-day conflicts without deleting or overwriting existing workouts.
- **Delete safety is outside the model's reach:** destructive tools are registered only when the process-level `ICUVISOR_DELETE_MODE` allows them; there is no per-call `confirm` argument for the assistant to invent.

The fastest path on Linux, macOS (without Homebrew), WSL, and CI is the shell installer:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://icuvisor.app/install.sh | sh
```

On native Windows / PowerShell:

```powershell
iwr -useb https://icuvisor.app/install.ps1 | iex
```

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md#installer-integrity) for installer signature verification and in-place update behaviour.

Prefer a package manager? Use `brew install ricardocabral/icuvisor/icuvisor` on macOS, or install from Winget on Windows:

```powershell
winget install --id RicardoCabral.icuvisor --exact
```

Open a new PowerShell or Command Prompt window after installation, then run `icuvisor version`. Windows users can also use the PowerShell installer above or download the `.msi` from the [releases page](https://github.com/ricardocabral/icuvisor/releases).

### Fitness projection with training-plan targets

`get_fitness_projection` can bridge weekly training-plan targets into future CTL/ATL/TSB scenarios without asking the assistant to invent daily loads. Provide `weekly_plan_targets` from planning context or `get_training_plan` output as ISO Monday week anchors; icuvisor distributes each weekly `training_load` evenly as `training_load/7` across projected future dates in that week. Explicit `planned_daily_loads` win for matching dates and are not redistributed.

```json
{
  "start_date": "2026-06-03",
  "horizon_days": 14,
  "weekly_plan_targets": [
    { "week_start_date": "2026-06-01", "training_load": 700 },
    { "week_start_date": "2026-06-08", "training_load": 840 }
  ],
  "planned_daily_loads": [
    { "date": "2026-06-10", "training_load": 60 }
  ]
}
```

The projection `_meta.assumptions` reports target counts, filled days, override counts, the ISO-Monday anchor convention, and `source_tools` adds `get_training_plan` when weekly targets are supplied.

Example calendar write prompt: "Mark me sick from 2026-08-10 through 2026-08-12" maps to `add_unavailable_date_range` with `category: "SICK"`, `start_date`, and `end_date`; use `include_full: true` only when raw upstream event payloads are needed.
