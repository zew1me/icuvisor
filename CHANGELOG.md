# Changelog

All notable changes to icuvisor are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added the tools-only `icuvisor-cli` contract with namespaced `tools list`, `tools describe`, and `tools call` commands, stdin argument support, compact progressive catalog discovery, canonical MCP descriptors, redacted `doctor` readiness, and machine-readable `capabilities`. MCP and direct calls now share local-athlete routing, registration gates, public-error sanitization, and per-call panic recovery; Resources and Prompts remain required follow-ups.

## [1.5.2] - 2026-07-15

### Added

- Added conditional `completion_load_evidence` to `get_today` planned workout rows for exact upstream event/activity links with a positive `load_target` and completed activity load, reporting the factual target, actual, and signed delta without inferring completion or a coaching verdict.

### Fixed

- Documented a resource-independent structured-workout authoring path: use `workout_doc` and `validate_workout` before approved writes, then verify the returned structured-step summary and fidelity warning when an MCP host does not make Resource contents available to the model.

## [1.5.1] - 2026-07-11

### Fixed

- Updated the release build toolchain to Go 1.25.12 to address GO-2026-5856 in `crypto/tls`.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-07-11

### Added

- Added `indoor_ftp` watt support to `update_sport_settings` and the full-toolset `create_sport_settings` tool for threshold-only creation of a missing sport setting. Creation requires a sport and at least one threshold, and cannot replace zones, recalculate HR zones, or apply settings to historical activities.
- Added the strictly read-only `masters_plan_review` MCP prompt, canonical portable pack, cookbook recipe, and `CB-MASTERS-*` evals for athlete-specific plan evidence, explicit data gaps, and conditional unapplied proposals without age-derived rules, medical claims, opaque scores, or calendar writes.
- Added cross-platform persistent loopback HTTP service recipes for macOS LaunchAgent, Linux systemd user service, and Windows Task Scheduler, including lifecycle recovery and hosted-connector boundaries.
- Added the read-only `fueling_review` MCP prompt, portable client prompt pack, cookbook recipe, and `CB-FUEL-*` eval coverage for source-labelled logged intake, transparent eligible-session grams/hour calculations, missing-data reporting, and no-target nutrition boundaries.
- Added the read-only `coaching_handoff` MCP prompt, portable client prompt pack, and cookbook workflow for manually carrying reviewed coaching decisions and source-labelled, athlete-local evidence into a fresh conversation.
- Added the full-toolset, read-only `compute_zone_energy` analyzer for timestamp-weighted external mechanical work in seconds and kJ by configured power zone, with explicit stream/zone coverage diagnostics and a pinned formula that distinguishes mechanical work from metabolic energy or calories.

### Fixed

- Corrected the canonical yard-distance suffix in the workout DSL from `yd` to `yrd`, aligning with the public intervals.icu workout-builder syntax. The serializer now emits `100yrd` for pool-swim yard distances; legacy `yd`, `yard`, and `yards` are accepted as backward-compatible input aliases and canonicalize to `yrd` on re-serialization.
- Corrected `get_annual_training_plan` note shaping to use upstream `plan_applied` provenance instead of English recovery keywords, keep personal calendar notes as neutral context, and exclude them from ATP note counts and recovery conclusions.
- Aligned `update_sport_settings` with the live intervals.icu contract: requests now send the required HR-zone recalculation option, reject the unsupported `effective_date` argument, and never implicitly apply settings to historical activities.
- Corrected sport-setting pace semantics: `threshold_pace` now reads and writes as upstream m/s with explicit athlete-facing duration fields, `pace_units` is display-only, and `pace_zones` are validated and returned as percentage-of-threshold boundaries rather than false durations.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-07-05

### Added

- Added downloadable/copyable Icuvisor prompt packs for Weekly review, Race-week taper, Ride analysis, and Coach roster triage client modes.
- Added the read-only `propose_annual_training_plan` MCP tool for deterministic season-plan proposals with phases, weekly load/hour targets, recovery weeks, race anchors, assumptions, warnings, and `get_fitness_projection` bridge rows without writing calendar data.
- Added the write-capable `apply_annual_training_plan` MCP tool for dry-run-gated, preview-token-protected season-plan phase-note writes with deterministic external IDs, idempotent retries, and protected calendar conflict reporting.

### Fixed

- Clarified athlete-profile FTP/zone metadata and planned-event indoor semantics so assistants distinguish `ftp_watts`, optional `indoor_ftp_watts`, zone boundaries, and event venue flags without hallucinating separate indoor/outdoor FTP values.
- Added HRV/HRV-SDNN analyzer freshness guardrails so stale or absent current-window wellness samples surface visible freshness status, caveats, and metadata instead of overconfident suppression claims.
- Hardened WorkoutDoc validation so fractional percent targets such as `0.95` in `% FTP` contexts are diagnosed instead of silently serializing as `0.95%`, with regression coverage for ramp direction, recovery cadence omission, and run/swim wording.
- Added calendar write/delete regression coverage for today-starting unavailable ranges, protected training-plan conflicts, sparse event deletes, and explicit confirmation metadata on event writes/deletes.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- Added yards-based swim workout support, including `SECS_100Y` pace fields/writes, `/100y` target previews, and canonical `yd` WorkoutDoc distance syntax.
- Added the `coach_athlete_onboarding` MCP prompt for read-only coach/team first sessions, including authorization checks, data-quality checklist output, baseline context, races/goals, device/source caveats, and missing-data warnings.
- Added the read-only `get_data_quality_report` MCP tool and cookbook guidance to diagnose missing streams, Strava restrictions, HR/TRIMP-only load, stale wellness, missing thresholds/zones, sparse history, and calendar/race data gaps.
- Added `ICUVISOR_TOOLSET=compact`, a reduced read-focused MCP tool catalog for smaller/local clients, plus routing eval coverage and client guidance for choosing compact, core, or full profiles.
- Added a beginner "what can I ask icuvisor?" prompt guide, setup/connect cross-links, LLM discovery links, and expanded troubleshooting for Strava-restricted data, missing streams, HR/TRIMP load, stale activities, and client tool-selection confusion.
- Added data-availability diagnostics for Strava-restricted activity streams and missing stream channels, plus load diagnostics that preserve HR/TRIMP `training_load` without relabeling it as TSS.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-06-26

### Added

- Added the read-only `get_performance_potential` MCP tool for per-sport FTP/threshold, power/pace/HR curve-anchor, and unavailable-threshold caveat summaries, with routing eval coverage for performance-potential and aerobic/anaerobic-threshold prompts.
- Added explicit workout status fields and caveats to calendar, daily digest, and compliance outputs so assistants distinguish planned, completed, future, and missed/skipped workouts without inferring from activity co-occurrence.
- Added after-kJ durability curves to `get_power_curves`, including explicit kilojoule work-threshold metadata and omission of unavailable or uncomputed durability rows.
- Added the read-only `get_activities_around` MCP tool for activities recorded near a known reference activity ID, with routing guidance to keep arbitrary historical windows on `get_activities`.
- Added first-tool routing eval cases for arbitrary historical activity-window prompts that should start with `get_activities`.

### Changed

- Clarified planning and race-week taper prompts/docs to resolve relative dates, weekdays, and countdowns with `resolve_calendar_dates` before planning, and to use `get_fitness_projection` for race-day form assumptions.

### Fixed

- WorkoutDoc run pace targets now serialize absolute `MINS_KM` and `MINS_MILE` values as explicit `mm:ss/km Pace` and `mm:ss/mi Pace` structured workout targets instead of requiring pace text labels.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-06-23

### Added

- Added first-tool routing eval cases and save/diff reporting for ambiguous planning prompts, including ATP/periodization versus raw events, training-plan assignment, and fitness projection contrasts.
- Added MCP Registry `server.json` metadata, Cursor install CTA validation, and release-publishing recovery guidance for distribution maintainers.
- Added the read-only `get_annual_training_plan` MCP tool for ATP/periodization summaries from PLAN, TARGET, and NOTE calendar events, including projection-ready weekly target bridge rows for `get_fitness_projection`.
- Added conservative hypoxic-training load caveats to activity reads, extended metrics, the training-analysis prompt, and public docs so assistants require explicit reduced-oxygen provenance and do not invent hypoxia multipliers.
- Added the `shareable_training_report` MCP prompt and cookbook guidance for privacy-safe Markdown training reports that athletes review/redact and share manually without icuvisor publishing or hosting private data.
- Added opt-in per-sport load trends to `get_fitness`, computing warmed running/cycling/swimming/other CTL/ATL/TSB-style estimates from visible summary category load with multisport planning caveats.
- Added explicit activity custom-field selection for activity reads and `analyze_correlation`, including `custom:<field_code>` correlation metrics for VO2Max-like field histories with provenance and insufficient-data metadata.
- Added weather provenance to `get_today` and `get_activities`: completed activities expose Intervals.icu historical weather when present, while daily forecast gaps are explicit so assistants do not invent conditions.
- Added indoor/outdoor adaptation guidance to the recovery prompt, cookbook recipes, and eval scenarios, including the guardrail to avoid duplicate active calendar workouts for one planned session.
- Added `get_planning_context` season context, exposing read-only `SEASON_START` season-boundary rows with bounded multi-year window metadata for planning prompts.
- Added `pkg/icuvisor`, a public Go facade for reusing icuvisor's core MCP server, tool/resource/prompt registries, Intervals client wiring, catalog metadata, and Streamable HTTP handler from other Go modules without importing internal packages.

### Changed

- `get_activity_intervals` now adds a single-row collapsed/imported-lap caveat and `compute_activity_segment_stats` follow-up hint when interval provenance is unknown, so assistants do not treat one averaged lap as proof of no interval work.
- The OpenAPI endpoint-diff workflow now uses the live intervals.icu OpenAPI docs URL, reports `components.schemas` name drift alongside path drift, and refreshes the pinned baseline to the current accepted upstream snapshot.
- The default non-coach CLI/MCP startup path now uses the public `pkg/icuvisor` facade, with parity coverage against the internal wiring; hosted deployments can depend on the public core library while keeping hosted OAuth, storage, and deployment code separate.

### Fixed

- Hardened WorkoutDoc target serialization for device-facing workout exports, including pace/HR/power regressions and all athlete sport target-priority orderings that need explicit zone metric suffixes.
- Documented the validated Windows Winget install path in the README, website install guides, and Windows release runbook.
- Clarified Windows and ChatGPT connection documentation after Windows VM install testing, including PowerShell-first Windows install guidance, exact Windows credential cleanup, platform-specific MCP command examples, and hosted ChatGPT connector limitations.
- Clarified the Claude Desktop manual setup docs for Windows users, including the `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` path and the `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\icuvisor\icuvisor.exe` command path.
- Made the Windows PowerShell installer ASCII-only so saving `install.ps1` and running it as a file works under Windows PowerShell 5.1.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-10

### Added

- Added Codex-compatible Streamable HTTP smoke coverage that verifies `initialize` and `ping` responses are strict JSON-RPC 2.0 envelopes over raw in-process HTTP.
- Added athlete-profile `_meta.warnings` for missing sport thresholds and zones so assistants can preflight threshold- or zone-based planning before producing advice.
- Added WorkoutDoc regression coverage proving a trailing cooldown remains a top-level sibling after a named repeat main set.
- Added `add_unavailable_date_range` for retry-safe Sick, Injured, and Holiday/time-off calendar blocks across inclusive date ranges, with duplicate skipping and same-day conflict metadata.

### Changed

- `get_fitness_projection` now accepts `weekly_plan_targets` copied from planning/training-plan context and deterministically distributes each weekly load target across projected days, while explicit `planned_daily_loads` keep precedence and metadata reports the bridge assumptions.
- `get_activity_intervals` now distinguishes manually added and mixed interval-source evidence in `_meta.interval_source`, alongside existing structured-workout, device-lap, and unknown classifications.

### Fixed

- Added regression coverage ensuring activity `gear_id` values without embedded names resolve via the full gear list, while unknown IDs remain explicit without invented `gear_name` values.
- Hardened `get_today` so athlete-local current-day metadata cannot be combined with previous-day fitness, wellness, activity, or event rows when upstream returns stale rows around morning partial/absent wellness.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-04

### Fixed

- Workout writes now set `_meta.workout_doc_warning` when intervals.icu returns a parsed `workout_doc` that partially differs from the uploaded structured workout, catching cases such as flattened repeat blocks or dropped RPE targets instead of warning only on total parse failure.

## [0.1.9] - 2026-06-04

### Added

- Added read-only `icuvisor_check_server_version` MCP diagnostic for comparing visible tool-description version/fingerprint fields with the running server's local catalog metadata after upgrades.
- Added generated per-tool argument schema and input-example data to the public tool reference so docs stay aligned with the registered MCP catalog.
- Added optional `add_or_update_event.external_id` support for retry-safer calendar writes, including terse event-read audit visibility and conservative blank/no-clear semantics.
- Added deterministic `icuvisor-plan-v1-...` external IDs for `apply_training_plan` events so repeated applies are safer and matching existing plan events are protected during replacement while preserving same-day/upstream idempotency caveats.

### Changed

- Expanded MCP tool schema snapshots to cover the full coach-enabled, full-capability registry so newly registered public tools cannot miss drift checks silently.

### Fixed

- Planned workout writes from `add_or_update_event`, `create_workout`, `update_workout`, and `apply_training_plan` now use athlete sport settings to emit explicit zone metric suffixes (`Z2 Power`, `Z2 HR`, `Z2 Pace`) when the upstream sport priority order would make bare zones ambiguous.

## [0.1.8] - 2026-06-03

### Added

- Added maintainer OpenAPI endpoint-diff tooling, workflow automation, and triage documentation for spotting upstream intervals.icu path changes.
- Added compact `workout_doc_summary.target_previews` on planned workout/event rows, resolving supported `% FTP`, `% LTHR`/`% HR`, and threshold-pace targets from existing athlete sport settings without exposing raw workout docs by default.
- Added running threshold-pace and pace-zone regression coverage for seconds-per-kilometer/seconds-per-mile conversions and Run pace-zone boundary/name round trips.
- Added read-only `get_planning_context` MCP tool for weekly planning context, combining week events/workouts, active training-plan summary, current fitness context, upcoming races, caveats, and no-ATP/no-write metadata.
- Added a Codex CLI connection guide covering `codex mcp add`, `config.toml`, safe non-secret environment configuration, and MCP verification.
- Added calendar-write regression coverage for repeated `apply_training_plan` calls and same-day duplicate planned events.

### Changed

- Activity read tool descriptions now route lap/rep execution analysis through `get_activity_intervals` and its `_meta.interval_source` / `_meta.auto_lap_suspected` signals, so assistants do not infer structured-workout execution from `get_activity_details` alone.
- Hardened weekly-review and plan-health prompts so assistants anchor report windows in athlete-local dates, keep post-window wellness out of completed-period evidence, and label current-day `_meta.as_of` data as partial-day context.
- Updated tool-routing smoke fixtures to match current preparatory lookup/date-resolution behavior and clarified advanced-capabilities routing guidance so it does not steal requests from visible tools.

### Fixed

- `apply_training_plan` now protects races, notes, holidays, sick/injured blocks, and unknown non-workout calendar items during `replace_existing`, reporting conflict category/type/name/date details instead of deleting protected days.
- `add_or_update_event` and `apply_training_plan` now preflight same-day calendar events, skip exact duplicate creates, and surface same-day conflict warnings/metadata to reduce duplicate workouts during retries.
- Added WorkoutDoc repeat-header regression coverage so repeat blocks serialize as canonical `3x` or `<description> 3x` headers and dashed malformed variants are rejected during parsing/validation.
- Hardened readiness provenance prompts and regressions so Garmin Body Battery, Oura readiness, Polar nightly recharge/ANS charge, WHOOP recovery, and unknown upstream readiness are cited with provider/source labels instead of as generic recovery scores.
- Added regression coverage so long-distance calendar race/event distances such as 1,200 km are accepted and preserved in meters without false load auto-calculation claims.
- Hardened coach-mode athlete routing errors so invalid athlete IDs, unauthorized roster targets, per-athlete ACL denials, and local-mode athlete overrides fail explicitly without accepting credential-like tool parameters.

## [0.1.7] - 2026-06-01

### Fixed

- Windows standalone binaries now embed the IANA timezone database so valid zones like `Europe/Madrid`, `Europe/Paris`, and `Europe/Brussels` are accepted during startup. (#37)

## [0.1.6] - 2026-05-29

### Added

- Added regression coverage and cookbook guidance for tag-aware, fueling-aware activity reads without requiring `include_full:true`.
- Documented the strength-training upstream API gap and current best-effort gym support via simple calendar notes or supported events.
- Cookbook eval scenarios now cover athlete-local date lookup before activity detail/interval/split analysis for prompts like race retrospectives and run split comparisons.
- Regression coverage now verifies `get_today`, `get_events`, and the cookbook eval keep multiple same-day planned workouts distinct alongside NOTE/race annotations.
- New curated MCP prompt `plan_health_review` guides assistants through a transparent planned-vs-completed adherence, load/form projection, wellness caveat, deload/recovery-week, and race-risk audit without inventing an opaque plan-health score.
- New read-only `resolve_calendar_dates` MCP tool returns deterministic athlete-local date and weekday anchors for today, tomorrow, future offsets, and supplied base dates so planning prompts do not rely on model date arithmetic.
- Safety eval/adversarial coverage now checks that assistants edit tomorrow's scheduled workout in place via the existing calendar event instead of deleting, recreating, or mutating workout-library templates.

### Changed

- Weekly planning and workout cookbook guidance now allow simple gym time blocks while warning that detailed structured strength sets remain future scope until upstream API support is documented.
- Recovery and weekly-review prompts now tell assistants to state missing/null Intervals readiness before using HRV, resting HR, sleep, subjective wellness scales, and provider `_native` fields as cautious fallback evidence.
- The readiness-check cookbook now includes Garmin/null-readiness fallback guidance while preserving explicit sleepQuality, sleepScore, feel, and provider-native scale labels.
- Activity tool descriptions and the activity-retrospective cookbook now make the `get_activities` → `activity_id` → detail/interval/splits routing path explicit for described or relative-date activities.
- README positioning now highlights icuvisor's local-first credentials, single-binary install, terse structured responses, explicit units/scales, and registration-time delete safety.
- Hardened workout-library guidance and tests so assistants use folder-scoped, terse examples by default and only request full template payloads after selecting a specific workout.
- Hardened workout create/update/schedule guidance so prompts, tool descriptions, generated tool catalog data, and cookbook examples ask assistants to preview total duration, key steps, target intensities, load/distance/time deltas, and preserved fields before writes.
- Hardened segment-comparison activation with cookbook guidance, eval coverage, and unit tests so first-vs-last distance prompts use `compute_activity_segment_stats` instead of chat-side raw-stream reduction.
- Hardened the `weekly_planning`, `weekly_review`, and `race_week_taper` MCP prompts so season/race planning gathers race priority/date context, active plans, planned events, current load, recent completion/compliance, and explicit approval before any calendar writes.
- Expanded `add_or_update_event` race input examples to cover `RACE_A`, `RACE_B`, and `RACE_C` with sport type, date, distance, expected duration, and target load.

### Fixed

- `delete_activity` now calls Intervals.icu's activity tombstone endpoint and reports matching `source_endpoint` metadata, preserving delete-mode gating and target-athlete safety checks.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-05-27

### Added

- Documentation now explains stale conversations and cached MCP tool catalogs, including when to start a new chat, reconnect tools, verify `icuvisor version`, run `icuvisor diagnostics`, and avoid pasting API keys into assistant conversations.
- New curated MCP prompt `weekly_review` guides assistants through a structured previous-week training review, planned-vs-completed comparison, wellness caveats, and optional next-week preview using existing read/analyzer tools.
- Time-relative reads now include athlete-local as-of anchors: `get_today` always returns `_meta.as_of`, `_meta.as_of_date`, `_meta.as_of_weekday`, and `_meta.timezone`, and `get_activities`, `get_events`, and `get_wellness_data` return the same metadata when the requested range includes the athlete-local current day.
- Wellness rows now include row-level `_meta.field_semantics` for `hydration` and `hydrationVolume` when those fields are present, preserving the upstream field names without inventing units.
- Terse event and activity read responses now include upstream `tags` arrays when intervals.icu returns them, preserving order and explicit empty lists without requiring `include_full:true`.

### Changed

- `add_or_update_event`, `create_workout`, and `update_workout` now merge free-text `description` prose with structured `workout_doc` steps instead of forcing callers to choose one source; the `<!-- icuvisor:steps -->` sentinel controls insertion point when present.
- Clarified write-tool and planning guidance that `description` writes replace the upstream description/DSL field rather than appending notes; preserving structured workout steps on updates requires supplying the desired `workout_doc` explicitly.

### Fixed

- `add_or_update_event` and `update_workout` now surface `_meta.description_only_workout_warning` when an existing workout-shaped item is updated with `description` but no `workout_doc`, so assistants can avoid accidentally replacing structured steps when they only intended to add prose.
- Structured WorkoutDoc serialization now rejects step descriptions containing duration or distance tokens (for example `2h15m`, `45m`, `400mtr`, or `5km`) so planned workout duration/load cannot be doubled by submitting both a structured duration field and an inline DSL time token. `validate_workout` reports this as `STRUCTURAL_TOKEN_IN_STEP_DESCRIPTION`.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-05-24

### Added

- Shell installers at `https://icuvisor.app/install.sh` (POSIX sh; Linux, macOS, WSL, Git-Bash, CI) and `https://icuvisor.app/install.ps1` (native Windows PowerShell). Both detect OS/arch, pick the right release archive, verify the SHA-256 checksum, and verify the keyless Sigstore signature on `SHA256SUMS.txt` when `cosign` is available. The release workflow now signs `SHA256SUMS.txt` with cosign keyless OIDC and publishes the `.pem` + `.sig` alongside it. Re-running the installer updates an existing install in place: it reuses the directory of any `icuvisor` already on `PATH`, refuses to overwrite Homebrew- or Scoop-managed binaries (directing users to `brew upgrade` / `scoop update` instead), short-circuits when already at the target version (`--force` / `-Force` to override), uses an atomic rename so a running binary keeps executing off its old inode, and exposes `--check` / `-Check` for "is an update available?" in scripts (exit 0 = up to date, 1 = update available).
- `get_today` read-only MCP tool returns one terse daily digest for "how's today looking?": today's CTL/ATL/TSB, wellness, completed activities, planned events, and NOTE/race annotations, with `include_full` widening each source-shaped section.
- New `update_activity` write MCP tool renames and/or edits the free-text description of one completed activity by `activity_id` with sparse fields (omit to leave unchanged; explicit empty string clears the description). Non-destructive metadata edit that does not alter recorded streams or interval analysis; gated by `ICUVISOR_DELETE_MODE` like other write tools (registered in `safe` and `full`).
- New `set_activity_intervals` delete-mode MCP tool writes a structured `workout_doc` as one completed activity's description so intervals.icu re-parses the DSL into rendered intervals; optional `prose` argument is interleaved verbatim around the serialized steps. The response `_meta.interval_source_intent: "structured_workout"` records the write's intent so downstream readers can distinguish a manually written interval set from device auto-laps (see `internal/analysis/interval_source.go`); `_meta.workout_doc_warning` is set when upstream stored the description but did not parse the DSL. Treated as destructive: registered only when `ICUVISOR_DELETE_MODE=full`.
- New read-only `validate_workout` MCP tool validates a free-text `description`, a structured `workout_doc`, or both, and returns the canonical merged DSL icuvisor would submit on a write. Prose passes through verbatim; only malformed structured-step lines surface as PARSE_ERROR. The reusable merge logic lives in `internal/workoutdoc.MergeDescription` for future write-path use.
- MCP tool calls now emit structured `slog` entries for call start/completion, including tool name, status, duration, redacted argument/response byte counts, and approximate MCP token counts (`bytes/4`) without logging raw arguments or response payloads.
- `get_activities` and `get_activity_details` now surface athlete-defined activity custom fields under each row's `custom_fields` map in terse mode. The field codes are discovered from `ACTIVITY_FIELD` custom-item definitions (fetched once per athlete and cached) and `get_activities` requests them alongside its terse field set so field-limited list responses still include them. Previously these values were only reachable with `include_full:true`. A custom-item lookup failure degrades gracefully: the activity read still succeeds, just without `custom_fields`.
- `get_activities` and `get_activity_details` responses now report the athlete IANA timezone in `_meta.timezone` — the zone each row's `start_date_local` is expressed in — so assistants derive calendar dates from the athlete's timezone instead of reporting activities on the wrong day.
- `add_or_update_event` now accepts a top-level `indoor` boolean and event reads echo `indoor`, allowing assistants to set intervals.icu's planned-event Indoor toggle for trainer rides instead of relying on tags or `VirtualRide` alone.

### Changed

- Homebrew formula and Scoop manifest homepages now point at `https://icuvisor.app` (the canonical project site) instead of the unused `icuvisor.dev`.
- Expand `icuvisor://workout-syntax` resource with a cheat sheet and common-mistakes section; nudge `add_or_update_event`, `create_workout`, `update_workout`, and the `weekly_planning` prompt toward structured `workout_doc` + coexisting prose and recommend a `validate_workout` pre-flight when uncertain about the DSL.

### Fixed

- `add_or_update_event` now treats an explicit `tags: []` as a tag-clearing update and sends `"tags": []` upstream instead of omitting the field as "no change".

## [0.1.3] - 2026-05-22

### Fixed

- Setup and athlete-ID validation now accept the bare-numeric athlete IDs that intervals.icu issues to Strava-linked accounts (e.g. `612345`), not just the `i12345` form. The previous validation rejected any ID without a leading `i`, blocking setup for those athletes. Bare-numeric IDs are kept as-is — the `i` prefix is part of the ID and is never added or stripped. (#24)

## [0.1.2] - 2026-05-22

### Added

- `get_activity_intervals` now exposes scalar upstream custom interval fields, such as manually-entered lactate values, under each interval's `custom_fields` map in terse mode without requiring `include_full:true`.
- `create_workout`, `update_workout`, and `add_or_update_event` now set `_meta.workout_doc_warning` when a structured `workout_doc` was uploaded but intervals.icu did not parse it into a rendered structured workout, so callers learn the workout will display as plain text without graphical interval segments instead of silently assuming success.

### Changed

- Strava-blocked activity reads now report a single stable `unavailable.reason` of `strava_blocked` across every tool. `get_activities` and `get_activity_messages` previously emitted `strava_tos` for the same condition that `get_activity_details`, `get_extended_metrics`, and `get_activity_streams` reported as `strava_blocked`.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-05-21

### Added

- Cookbook section on the documentation website (`web/content/cookbook/`): a quick prompt library plus eight reusable multi-step recipes (weekly review, readiness check, activity retrospective, FTP/zones review, season and block plan, build and schedule workouts, race-week taper, coach roster triage). Each recipe is written for reliable tool activation and grounded, hallucination-resistant answers, derived from common athlete and coach tasks on the intervals.icu forum.
- Cookbook activation and answer-quality eval harness (`scripts/eval/`): self-contained scenario specs, an LLM-judge rubric scoring tool activation, grounding, subjective-scale correctness, coverage, actionability, and conciseness, and a `run_eval.py` runner with a CI-safe `--validate` mode (`make eval-validate`) that checks scenarios against the tool catalog, plus a live mode that drives icuvisor over MCP stdio and scores each run.

### Fixed

- Interval `start_time` and `end_time` are now decoded correctly when intervals.icu returns them as numeric second offsets instead of strings. The previous string-only typing failed to decode those activities, breaking `get_extended_metrics`, `get_activity_intervals`, and `compute_activity_segment_stats` for them.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-21

### Fixed

- HTTP 422 responses from intervals.icu are now categorized as a stable `ErrValidation` sentinel (matchable via `errors.Is`/`errors.As`) instead of falling through to the generic `ErrUpstream` path. Write tools (`update_wellness`, `create_custom_item`, `update_custom_item`, `update_sport_settings`) parse the upstream rejection body to extract the offending field name and return a short, actionable message — for example `intervals.icu rejected field "WhoopStrain": create it under Settings > Custom Fields in intervals.icu, or omit it from this call`. The full upstream body is logged via `slog` and never surfaced to the LLM.

### Added

- `get_extended_metrics` now surfaces the strain-score power-duration model parameters when intervals.icu has fitted them: `strain_score_cp_watts` (critical power), `strain_score_w_prime_kj` (W', converted from upstream joules), and `strain_score_p_max_watts` (maximal power). Terse mode still drops them when upstream returns null.
- KR5 benchmark harness/report now compares analyzer-enabled versus analyzer-disabled fixture modes with v2 response-token metrics, source-tool usage validation, raw-stream pull counts, and TP-098 core-promotion evidence without promoting tools in this change.
- Documented the upstream coverage gap for precomputed per-activity zone-time fields after auditing the v0.2 fixture corpus with a reproducible local script.
- `analyze_trend`, `analyze_distribution`, `analyze_correlation`, and `analyze_efforts_delta` are registered in the full toolset to compute deterministic analyzer reductions with mandatory `_meta`, closed `analysis_metric` validation, terse-by-default responses, and unit-explicit best-efforts deltas.
- `compute_zone_time`, `compute_load_balance`, `compute_baseline`, and `compute_compliance_rate` are registered in the full toolset as deterministic analyzer-family compute tools using existing read outputs, mandatory analyzer `_meta`, explicit missing/insufficient signals, and activation hints that tell assistants not to roll their own row/stream reductions.
- `get_activity_histogram` summarizes one activity's power, heart-rate, or pace distribution into terse bucketed seconds/percentages using configured zones when available and fixed-width stream buckets otherwise.
- `compute_activity_segment_stats` is registered in the full toolset as the analyzer-family raw-stream exception, computing segment mean/median/p90, drift, Pw:HR decoupling, NP, and IF from canonical activity streams with mandatory analyzer `_meta`.
- `get_fitness_projection` simulates deterministic CTL/ATL/TSB scenarios from current fitness with horizon, ramp, recovery-week, and optional planned-load assumptions documented in analyzer `_meta`.
- `get_activity_intervals` now emits additive `_meta.interval_source` and `_meta.auto_lap_suspected` signals so generic device auto-laps are not confused with structured workout segments.
- Added shared analyzer response scaffolding so planned analyzer tools consistently emit mandatory `_meta.method`, `_meta.source_tools`, `_meta.n`, `_meta.missing_days`, `_meta.missing_action`, and `_meta.insufficient_sample` fields.
- Claude Desktop Extension (`.mcpb`) packaging for the macOS universal release artifact, including a binary-server manifest, secure Desktop-managed `api_key` configuration, local pack/validate tooling, and extension-first install docs.
- `icuvisor://analysis-formulas` MCP Resource documents canonical analyzer formula refs for HR drift, Pw:HR decoupling, polarization index, EF, VI, and z-score.
- `get_hr_curves` and `get_pace_curves` expose upstream-computed heart-rate and pace curves as full-toolset siblings to `get_power_curves`, with terse/default buckets, raw `include_full` payloads, and athlete-preferred pace units.
- Added NOTE-category examples for `add_or_update_event` so assistants and users can discover nutrition plans, travel logistics, daily reminders, and coach annotations without a separate note tool.
- Added reusable closed `analysis_metric` enum helpers for planned analyzer tools, including canonical schema values, conservative aliases, source metadata, and concise unknown-metric hints.
- `get_gear_list` lists intervals.icu gear IDs/names in the full toolset with a manual refresh path for the per-athlete gear cache.
- Activity reads now surface `gear_id`, resolved `gear_name`, and explicit `gear_resolution` statuses when upstream exposes gear IDs.
- Activity and wellness reads now disambiguate nutrition fields: activity `calories` is exposed as `calories_burned`, while wellness intake/macros use `calories_intake`, `carbs_g`, `protein_g`, and `fat_g` with `_meta.field_semantics` labels.
- Homebrew install path: releases now produce a `darwin_universal` tarball and publish a Homebrew formula to the [`ricardocabral/homebrew-icuvisor`](https://github.com/ricardocabral/homebrew-icuvisor) tap. Install with `brew install ricardocabral/icuvisor/icuvisor`. The macOS tarball binary is not yet codesigned independently of the DMG, so first run may require dismissing Gatekeeper; signing the tarball binary is tracked as a follow-up.

### Changed

- Promoted `analyze_trend`, `compute_zone_time`, and `compute_baseline` into the default core toolset after TP-098/KR5 benchmark evidence showed positive net token savings and eliminated or avoided LLM-visible raw-stream pulls.
- Analyzer-family tool descriptions now lead with concrete activation prompts and explicitly tell assistants not to fetch raw `get_*` rows or streams and reduce them in chat.
- Strava-blocked activity responses now point users to the intervals.icu Connections page and Download old data action for the native device provider, naming Garmin/Wahoo/etc. when explicit payload evidence is available.
- `get_wellness_data` provenance now reports provider-native sleep/readiness `native_scale` labels for Garmin, WHOOP, Oura, and Polar, while unresolved sources report `unknown` instead of a guessed device scale.
- Write-tool echo responses now strip upstream null keys by default, including custom-item create/update responses, while preserving meaningful zero, false, and empty-string values.
- Documented the TP-102 remote-connector decision: icuvisor will not add legacy SSE or generic public-tunnel recipes for ChatGPT-style remote custom connector UIs before the hosted relay; local stdio and loopback Streamable HTTP remain the supported ChatGPT paths.
- `icuvisor setup` now writes a non-secret `credential_ref` to generated config files so users and docs can see the OS keychain service/account while the API key remains outside JSON. Setup stores and verifies the keychain credential before writing the config file, so keychain failures do not leave a fresh onboarding config behind.

## [0.0.2] - 2026-05-19

### Changed

- `icuvisor setup` always prompts for the athlete ID and requires the `i` prefix (for example `i12345`). intervals.icu does not expose the ID through the API, so the previous `/athlete/0/profile` autodetect could silently succeed with an empty ID; the API key and athlete ID are now verified together against `/athlete/{id}`.
- The server loads the platform default config (`os.UserConfigDir()/icuvisor/config.json`) when neither `--config` nor `ICUVISOR_CONFIG` is set, so a fresh `icuvisor setup` works without needing an env file or explicit `--config` path.
- Startup logs drop the noisy "env file not found" line on healthy runs, log when the API key was loaded from the OS keychain, and include the active athlete ID and key source on the "server starting" line.

## [0.0.1] - 2026-05-18

### Added

- Initial public release.
