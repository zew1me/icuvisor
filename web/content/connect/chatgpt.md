ChatGPT MCP support is evolving across client and developer-mode surfaces. Use this page as the focused connection shape: point ChatGPT's MCP configuration at the local icuvisor binary and keep secrets out of the model conversation.

## Before you start

- Install icuvisor and run setup.
- Confirm the binary starts with `icuvisor version`.
- Know your non-secret athlete ID and timezone.

## Stdio configuration shape

Use the same stdio server definition as the Claude clients when ChatGPT asks for a local MCP server command:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "icuvisor": {
      "command": "/Applications/icuvisor.app/Contents/MacOS/icuvisor",
      "env": {
        "INTERVALS_ICU_ATHLETE_ID": "i12345",
        "ICUVISOR_TIMEZONE": "America/Sao_Paulo",
        "ICUVISOR_TRANSPORT": "stdio"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If your ChatGPT MCP surface expects a single server object rather than a full `mcpServers` map, use the `icuvisor` object from the example as that server definition.

## HTTP alternative

If your ChatGPT MCP surface expects an HTTP URL, start icuvisor with Streamable HTTP on loopback:

```bash
ICUVISOR_TRANSPORT=http /Applications/icuvisor.app/Contents/MacOS/icuvisor
```

Then point the client at:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp
```

Do not bind icuvisor to a LAN address unless you intentionally want other machines to reach the unauthenticated local MCP server. The HTTP transport guide covers the security tradeoff in more detail.

## Verify

Start a fresh ChatGPT conversation after saving the MCP configuration, then ask a simple profile question such as `What's my FTP?` The expected tool call is [`get_athlete_profile`]({{< relref "../reference/tools#get_athlete_profile" >}}).
