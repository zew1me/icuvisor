Install the icuvisor binary for local mode. Pick your platform below, then head to [Connect]({{< relref "/connect" >}}) to wire it into an AI client.

icuvisor itself is [MIT-licensed and open source](https://github.com/ricardocabral/icuvisor/blob/main/LICENSE), free to install and use. Local mode does not require an icuvisor-hosted account, onboarding credit, subscription, or icuvisor SaaS quota. If your MCP client needs a public HTTPS endpoint instead of a local process, use [hosted mode]({{< relref "../connect/hosted" >}}). Your AI client, model provider, download source, hosted connector, and intervals.icu account may still have their own terms or limits.

## Quick install

The fastest path on Linux, macOS (without Homebrew), WSL, and CI is the shell installer:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://icuvisor.app/install.sh | sh
```

On native Windows / PowerShell:

```powershell
iwr -useb https://icuvisor.app/install.ps1 | iex
```

Prefer Winget on Windows?

```powershell
winget install --id RicardoCabral.icuvisor --exact
```

The installer detects your platform, downloads the matching release asset, verifies the SHA256 checksum (and the cosign signature when `cosign` is on your `PATH`), and installs the binary. Re-run the same command to upgrade in place. See [installer integrity](https://github.com/ricardocabral/icuvisor/blob/main/SECURITY.md#installer-integrity) for signature verification details.

After installing, run `icuvisor setup` to store credentials safely and write non-secret defaults. If you maintain JSON config by hand or point a client at a config path, see the [config file reference]({{< relref "../reference/config-file" >}}); if your MCP client uses environment variables, see the [CLI environment variable reference]({{< relref "../reference/cli#environment-variables" >}}).
