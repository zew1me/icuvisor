### Step 0: Preflight

**Status:** ✅ Complete

- [x] Required files and paths exist
- [x] TP-228 is complete
- [x] Public m/s and percentage semantics confirmed

---

### Step 1: Define canonical pace conversions

**Status:** 🟨 In Progress

- [x] Read and write m/s formulas defined
- [x] pace_units presentation role defined
- [x] pace_zones percentage contract defined
- [x] Compatibility migration decided
- [x] R002: Apply the declared m/s and percentage response migration before advertising it in `_meta`
- [ ] R003: Propagate every recognized pace display unit and treat `NONE` as a known m/s fallback

---

### Step 2: Correct read shaping and typed models

**Status:** ⬜ Not Started

- [ ] Typed upstream fields completed
- [ ] Threshold pace read shaping corrected
- [ ] Percentage zone response added
- [ ] Unknown-unit fallback preserved

---

### Step 3: Correct sport-settings writes

**Status:** ⬜ Not Started

- [ ] Explicit pace inputs convert to m/s
- [ ] pace_units and pace_load_type are correct
- [ ] Pace-zone percentage validation implemented
- [ ] Delete-mode zone gate preserved

---

### Step 4: Replace misleading fixtures and lock semantics

**Status:** ⬜ Not Started

- [ ] Realistic upstream fixture values installed
- [ ] Run/swim/row round-trip scenarios covered
- [ ] m/s regression assertions added
- [ ] Percentage zones remain unchanged

---

### Step 5: Testing & Verification

**Status:** ⬜ Not Started

- [ ] FULL test suite passing
- [ ] Race suite passing
- [ ] Lint passing
- [ ] Build passes
- [ ] Generated docs clean

---

### Step 6: Documentation & Delivery

**Status:** ⬜ Not Started

- [ ] Must Update docs modified
- [ ] Check If Affected docs reviewed

## Discoveries

| Discovery | Disposition | Location |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| The planned `internal/athleteprofile/profile_test.go` does not exist; equivalent profile coverage currently lives under `internal/tools/get_athlete_profile_test.go`. | Create focused athleteprofile package tests during Step 2 if needed; all implementation paths and fixture locations exist. | `internal/athleteprofile/`, `internal/tools/get_athlete_profile_test.go` |

## Blockers

- TP-228 must complete first.

## Notes

- Preflight evidence (2026-07-10): the upstream forum confirms `threshold_pace` is always stored in SI m/s and `MINS_KM` is GUI-only presentation metadata; the server-model reference defines `pace_zones` as percentage-of-threshold boundaries.
- Step 1 plan: centralize two inverse conversions: display seconds = selected pace-distance metres / stored m/s, and stored m/s = selected pace-distance metres / supplied seconds. `pace_units` selects only the display distance, while `pace_zones` are copied as percent values to a newly named percentage field; existing `pace_zones_seconds_per_*` fields will be omitted rather than returned with false duration semantics. The migration is intentionally additive for correct values (`pace_zones_percent_of_threshold`) and omits false legacy duration fields rather than retaining a deprecated lie. Preserve unknown display units by returning m/s plus the raw `pace_units` source. Live OpenAPI confirms `pace_load_type` values `RUN`/`SWIM` and presentation enums including `SECS_100M`, `SECS_100Y`, `MINS_KM`, `MINS_MILE`, and `SECS_500M`.
