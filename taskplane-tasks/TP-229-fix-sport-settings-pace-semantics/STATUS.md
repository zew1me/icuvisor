## Discoveries

| Discovery | Disposition | Location |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| The planned `internal/athleteprofile/profile_test.go` does not exist; equivalent profile coverage currently lives under `internal/tools/get_athlete_profile_test.go`. | Create focused athleteprofile package tests during Step 2 if needed; all implementation paths and fixture locations exist. | `internal/athleteprofile/`, `internal/tools/get_athlete_profile_test.go` |

## Blockers

- TP-228 must complete first.

## Notes

- Preflight evidence (2026-07-10): the upstream forum confirms `threshold_pace` is always stored in SI m/s and `MINS_KM` is GUI-only presentation metadata; the server-model reference defines `pace_zones` as percentage-of-threshold boundaries.
- Step 1 plan: centralize two inverse conversions: display seconds = selected pace-distance metres / stored m/s, and stored m/s = selected pace-distance metres / supplied seconds. `pace_units` selects only the display distance, while `pace_zones` are copied as percent values to a newly named percentage field; existing `pace_zones_seconds_per_*` fields will be omitted rather than returned with false duration semantics. The migration is intentionally additive for correct values (`pace_zones_percent_of_threshold`) and omits false legacy duration fields rather than retaining a deprecated lie. Preserve unknown display units by returning m/s plus the raw `pace_units` source. Live OpenAPI confirms `pace_load_type` values `RUN`/`SWIM` and presentation enums including `SECS_100M`, `SECS_100Y`, `MINS_KM`, `MINS_MILE`, and `SECS_500M`.
- Step 2 plan: add `PaceLoadType string \`json:"pace_load_type"\`` to `intervals.SportSettings` and preserve its raw `RUN`/`SWIM` value into a `pace_load_type` response field. Shape `ThresholdPace` only as m/s through `PaceSecondsFromMetersPerSecond` for its `pace_units` distance, never profile-wide units or `PaceThreshold`; copy `PaceZones` unchanged to `pace_zones_percent_of_threshold` with names and metadata legend. Known `NONE`, unknown tokens, and finite conversion overflows retain only `threshold_pace_meters_per_second`; only an unknown non-empty token gets `_meta.unknown_unit`. Add table-driven decoding/shaping coverage for run km/mile, swim 100m/100y, row 500m, pace-load preservation, percentages/names/no legacy duration zones, and all fallback cases; leave fixture replacement to Step 4.
- Step 3 plan: convert each explicit duration input to seconds for its named distance, then call `response.PaceMetersPerSecondFromSeconds` and send only that m/s value as `threshold_pace`. Preserve an existing valid `pace_units` display preference (infer it solely when absent) and preserve a valid upstream `pace_load_type`, deriving `RUN` or `SWIM` only for a run/swim setting with no upstream value. Treat pace-zone boundaries as finite, strictly increasing percent values in `(0, 200]`; do not transform their values, keep the full delete-mode gate before clients, and describe the percentage contract in schema/examples. Cover m/s wire values, display/load metadata, invalid percent order/range, and safe-mode rejection.
