## Notes

### Step 1 reviewed implementation plan (R001)

- **Output contract, in order:** (1) `Handoff scope` with athlete-local generated-on date, timezone, and covered windows; (2) `Conversation-stated context` with separate Goals, Constraints, and Accepted decisions lists; (3) `Icuvisor evidence` as compact rows `Claim | Source tool | Athlete-local evidence date/window | Freshness/as-of`; (4) `Current plan state` containing only sourced calendar/training-plan state; (5) `Data gaps and unresolved questions`; (6) `Next actions`. A decision enters Accepted decisions only when the user explicitly accepted or stated it; assistant suggestions, model summaries, and calendar state do not become user decisions.
- **Dates/freshness:** call `get_athlete_profile` for timezone and `resolve_calendar_dates` for today/relative anchors, then use returned athlete-local dates. Record date/window describes when evidence applies; `as_of`/provider freshness describes how current it is. Preserve trustworthy returned freshness markers, label absent timestamps `not provided`, and never invent or require hidden `fetched_at` debug metadata.
- **Data quality:** surface `_meta.stale`, `_meta.missing_fields`, unavailable/Strava-blocked data, current-day partial rows, and unresolved tool failures. Missing is never zero and chat memory never fills a tool gap. When `next_page_token` exists, fetch pages needed for a completeness claim or label the result partial with covered window/count; omit opaque tokens from output.
- **Privacy/portability:** always exclude credentials, API/OAuth tokens, secrets, raw athlete IDs, local/config paths, raw payloads, raw streams, pagination tokens, and transport/debug metadata. Omit health details, precise locations, and private free-text notes by default; include only a user-approved minimum. The athlete manually reviews and copies Markdown into a fresh Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, or other client chat; never claim automatic import, persistence, or memory.
- **Read-only route:** always use `get_athlete_profile` and `resolve_calendar_dates`; use terse `get_events`, `get_training_plan`, `get_fitness`, `get_training_summary`, `get_activities`, and `get_wellness_data` only as needed for the compact sections. Optional deterministic analyzers may preserve evidence already material to the conversation; if absent, call `icuvisor_list_advanced_capabilities`, name the gap, and do not calculate substitutes in chat. Never use `include_full`, raw streams, write tools, or delete tools.
- **Arguments:** `lookback_days` is optional, defaults to 28, and accepts 1-90; `race_context_days` is optional, defaults to 90, and accepts 1-365. Invalid values return short user-facing errors. Race context remains sourced from athlete-local events/plan data, not inferred from chat.
- **Artifacts/checkpoint:** Step 1 creates the prompt function, portable pack, and focused `TestCoachingHandoff...` contract tests, making `go test ./internal/prompts -run 'CoachingHandoff'` non-vacuous. Step 2 only registers it, updates shared catalog/golden expectations, and adds the golden fixture. Step 3 updates `docs/prompts/README.md` along with public docs.
