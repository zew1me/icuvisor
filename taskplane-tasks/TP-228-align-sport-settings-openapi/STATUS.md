---

### Step 0: Preflight

**Status:** ✅ Complete

- [x] Required files and paths exist
- [x] Dependencies satisfied
- [x] Live public OpenAPI contract reconfirmed

---

### Step 1: Define the corrected write boundary

**Status:** ✅ Complete

- [x] Exact update/apply request contract documented
- [x] Public schema migration for effective_date decided
- [x] Implicit historical apply removed from design
- [x] Truthful response metadata defined
- [x] R001: Presence-aware `recalc_hr_zones` defaults to true while forwarding explicit false
- [x] R001: Regression plan covers default/false forwarding, no implicit apply, no-query/no-body apply, and legacy argument rejection

---

### Step 2: Align the intervals.icu client

**Status:** ✅ Complete

- [x] Required recalcHrZones query implemented
- [x] Apply PUT sends no date or semantic body
- [x] Update no longer invokes apply
- [x] Client contract tests pass
- [x] R004: Use retry-safe body-plus-query and bodyless PUT transport helpers without changing existing callers
- [x] R004: Exact wire coverage verifies true/false query, no implicit apply, and a zero-byte bodyless apply request

---

### Step 3: Align the MCP schema and response

**Status:** ✅ Complete

- [x] recalc_hr_zones schema and forwarding implemented
- [x] Unsupported effective-date behavior removed
- [x] Response metadata corrected
- [x] Schema snapshots and generated data updated
- [x] R007: Preserve explicit-false/default-true decoding and always emit truthful recalculation-requested metadata
- [x] R007: Narrowly approve only update_sport_settings effective_date removal without weakening generic schema-removal protection
- [x] R009: Add production schema-stability policy keyed by tool/property and test approved versus unrelated removals through CheckSchemaStability
- [x] R011: Reject explicit null recalc_hr_zones before profile or writer calls

---

### Step 4: Regression coverage

**Status:** ✅ Complete

- [x] Exact update/apply wire tests added
- [x] No-implicit-apply regression added
- [x] Legacy invalid argument behavior covered
- [x] R013: Strengthen exact-query and single-update assertions without duplicating existing contract coverage

---

### Step 5: Testing & Verification

**Status:** ✅ Complete

- [x] FULL test suite passing
- [x] Race suite passing
- [x] Lint passing
- [x] Build passes
- [x] Generated docs clean

---

## Notes

- R001 plan review: legacy `effective_date` must be rejected by strict decoding before an upstream request; response metadata may only report the requested HR-zone recalculation boolean.
- R004 plan review: client resolves no input defaults; it encodes a resolved `RecalcHRZones` bool and uses body-plus-query update and bodyless-PUT apply transports that preserve retries and 422 handling.
- R007 plan review: schema stability needs a TP-228-only approved effective_date-removal exception; generic property-removal detection remains enforced.
- Step 3 implementation plan: (1) replace `EffectiveDate` with `*bool RecalcHRZones` in the tool request; decoding resolves nil to true and passes the resulting bool to `WriteSportSettingsParams.RecalcHRZones`; remove `EffectiveDate` from internal params. (2) Delete `effective_date` from the strict type, validation, public strings, schema requirements/properties/examples, metadata, and tests, relying on `DecodeStrict` to reject it before profile/writer calls. (3) Replace date/recompute metadata with always-emitted `hr_zone_recalculation_requested` equal to the resolved option. (4) Make sport the sole required schema field, add `recalc_hr_zones` as optional boolean default true with an LLM-readable description, then regenerate snapshot and website catalogs with `make docs-tools`. (5) Add table-driven omitted/default-true and explicit-false forwarding/metadata tests plus legacy-date/unknown/null rejection with zero client calls. (6) Add production `approvedSchemaPropertyRemovals` keyed by tool/property in schema_stability.go; `compareStableSchema` consults it solely before a property-removed failure. Its sole durable TP-228 rationale approves `update_sport_settings.effective_date`; CheckSchemaStability tests prove a different property and another tool's effective_date still fail. Run `go test ./internal/tools ./internal/toolchecks`.
- Step 4 implementation plan: retain the local-server true/false update and bodyless direct-apply tests, strengthen update to assert `RawQuery` is exactly `recalcHrZones=true|false`, and explicitly count exactly one update while rejecting `/apply`. Retain strict-decoding legacy-date, unknown, and null cases with exact terse errors and zero profile/writer calls. Change tests only, then run `go test ./internal/intervals ./internal/tools`.
