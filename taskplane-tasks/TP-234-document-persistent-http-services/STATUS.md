### Step 1: Design secure service recipes

**Status:** 🟨 In Progress

**Expanded plan (R001):** The guide will define three per-user, logged-in recipes: `app.icuvisor.http` at `~/Library/LaunchAgents/app.icuvisor.http.plist`, launched in `gui/$(id -u)` with `RunAtLoad`, `KeepAlive.SuccessfulExit=false`, `/` working directory, and `~/Library/Logs/icuvisor/http-service.log`; `icuvisor-http.service` at `~/.config/systemd/user/icuvisor-http.service`, with `Restart=on-failure`, `RestartSec=5`, `/` working directory, and journal inspection; and a current-user interactive-only `icuvisor-http` Task Scheduler task with an unlimited execution limit, a non-secret PowerShell wrapper/log in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\icuvisor\http-service`, and `C:\Windows\System32` as the task working directory. All service launches use an absolute icuvisor binary path with literal `--transport http --http-bind 127.0.0.1:8765`; `http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp` is client-only.

Each recipe will require interactive `icuvisor setup` under the same OS account first, use the default per-user non-secret config and credential store, and forbid API-key variables, `.env`, `--env-file`, service-manager environment directives, `api_key` config, or Task Scheduler credential arguments. These recipes neither use Linux lingering nor a service account, so the credential store remains in the logged-in user's session boundary. It will specify status/log/restart/stop/disable-or-unload/remove recovery commands and remove the wrapper/log where applicable. The HTTP transport LAN code block will be replaced with warning-only prose. A path-specific contract plus Make/CI target will validate both HTTP guides for OS lifecycle content, loopback-only executable samples, no credential material, `/mcp`, TP-232's hosted URL/no-tunnel policy, remote provider connector boundary/hosted OAuth, and the connector key `icuvisor`.

- [x] Built-in lifecycle mechanism selected per OS
- [x] Credential-store-only design confirmed
- [x] Loopback endpoint fixed in examples
- [x] Lifecycle and hosted fallback coverage planned
- [x] R001: User-scoped service definitions, identities, logs, and lifecycle commands specified
- [x] R001: Session-safe credential boundary and `.env`-safe working directories specified
- [x] R001: Failure recovery and removal behavior specified for each manager
- [x] R001: LAN executable example removal and Make/CI contract scope specified
