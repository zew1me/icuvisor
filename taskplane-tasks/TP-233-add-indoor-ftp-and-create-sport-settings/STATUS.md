## Notes

| Date | Topic | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-07-10 | R001 Step 1 plan | Add `IndoorFTP *int` only to `WriteSportSettingsParams`; introduce separate `CreateSportSettingsParams{Sport, FTP, IndoorFTP, ThresholdHR, ThresholdPace}` and return `SportSettings`. `SportSettingsPace` is pre-normalized m/s plus selected `PaceUnits` and explicit/preserved `PaceLoadType`, serialized without client reinterpretation. |
| 2026-07-10 | R001 HTTP contract | Update remains `PUT /athlete/{athleteID}/sport-settings/{id}?recalcHrZones=<bool>` and writes `indoor_ftp` only when supplied. Create is no-retry `POST /athlete/{athleteID}/sport-settings`, no query string, with sparse `types:[sport]` and only `ftp`, `indoor_ftp`, `lthr`, `threshold_pace` (m/s), `pace_units`, and `pace_load_type`; it cannot carry ID, recalculation, or zones. |
| 2026-07-10 | R001 validation | Before transport reject blank sport, non-positive FTP/indoor FTP/HR, and non-finite/non-positive canonical pace; errors name create/update and make no request. No `indoor_ftp <= ftp` restriction: no confirmed upstream/product rule. Client leaves sport enum ownership to the MCP layer. |
| 2026-07-10 | R001 client tests | Local-server cases will assert update-only `indoor_ftp` and create `types:["Ride"]`/indoor FTP method/path/raw-query/sparse body/no zone-or-recalc fields plus returned echo, m/s pace keys, and table-driven invalid update/create calls with zero requests. |
| 2026-07-10 | Step 2 plan | Extend update request, conversion params, response echo, metadata, input schema, description, and examples with sparse `indoor_ftp` only: `indoor_ftp` → `WriteSportSettingsParams.IndoorFTP`, `indoor_ftp_watts` from returned value with supplied fallback, and sorted `_meta.fields_updated`. |
| 2026-07-10 | R004 validation order | `create_sport_settings` strictly decodes then canonicalizes/validates the documented sport and requires one non-nil threshold field before any profile or create call. It then reads the profile once, uses `findSportSetting` across `Type`/`Types` to reject duplicates with “use update_sport_settings”, and only then calls create. Request/schema exclude recalc, zones, confirmation, and credentials. |
| 2026-07-10 | R004 pace and public echo | Creation converts duration to canonical m/s using an empty existing setting, selecting input display units and Run/Swim load type. `sport_settings` returns sport, created `sport_setting_id`, only applicable FTP/indoor-FTP/HR pointers, and existing m/s-derived pace echo plus units/load type. `_meta` returns operation `create`, sorted `fields_created`, server/timezone/unit data, and pace metadata only when relevant; no apply/recalc/zone metadata. |
| 2026-07-10 | R004 catalog and snapshot | Register `newCreateSportSettingsTool` as full/write in `registryBaseTools`; add `CreateSportSettings` to the athlete-scoped canonical catalog, full-tier map, and `toolCatalogGroup` settings case. Update schema registry count 69→70 and required `create_sport_settings` snapshot, generated by `go run ./scripts/snapshot_tool_schemas.go`. Focused tests cover creator FTP/indoor/HR plus Run/Swim pace paths. |
